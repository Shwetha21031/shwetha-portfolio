# ✨ Shwetha — Portfolio

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my personal portfolio — a space where I showcase my work, experiment with interactions, and let a bit of my personality shine through.

This site isn’t just about projects; it’s about how I think, design, and build experiences on the web.

## 🎧 A Little About Me

This portfolio is intentionally personal.

- I’ve added **my favorite song** to the site because music plays a huge role in my creative flow.
- Animations are designed with rhythm and timing in mind — almost like choreography.
- I enjoy building interfaces that feel calm, thoughtful, and just a little playful.
